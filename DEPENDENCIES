# 1st Party Dependencies
## Prefer git tags instead of SHA hashes when possible.

# Change:
# libpEpAdapter does not specify any dependencies atm.
# libpEpAdapter is always being used as part of an adapter
# This adapter has to specify the pEpEngine version .e.g


# fdik: dep graph has to be taken from DEP file
# fdik: dependencies need to be resolved recursively from top to bottom
# fdik: stack then needs to be built from the bottom up
